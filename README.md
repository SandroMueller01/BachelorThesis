# BachelorThesis
Here you can find my Bachelor Thesis which has the title "Utilising a bioimpedance measurement to sense muslce contraction" and was written in the collabroations with the Managment Center Innsbruck in the couse of the study program Mechatronic-Medical Technologies.

## Abstract of the thesis
Measuring impedance can be beneficial in many disciplines. Areas in which impedance
measurement is used are audio engineering, power electronics and many more. The
impedance measurement is also used in medicine. For example, to estimate composition
of body parts. Therefore body parts consists out of water, fat tissue, muscle mass
and many more. The impedance measurement is also used in biology, to determine
the cell growth of a cell.
The work aims to determine the muscle contraction of the human forearm. Machine
learning is used to recognise the individual movement of each finger.
For the measurement a basic impedance measurement is used. To measure a predeveloped
hardware from MAXIM Integrated used. The benefit of this hardware is that
parameters can get alternated threw out each measurement. Therefore the optimal
configuration of the parameters can be easily found. The goal of the tuning of the
parameters is to reach a significant difference of resistance between a contraction and
no contraction.
The measured data should then processed with a machine learning algorithm to determine
the muscle contraction of the individual fingers. Beforehand the data has to
processed to it needs and then labeled. Therefore six different classes are used. The
six classes are called: Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinki and Nothing. Therefore the
label correspond to the name of the finger.
The procedure created could be used to control a hand prosthesis.
